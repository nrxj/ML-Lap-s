*Problem Description*
This project aims to analyze the Heart Disease dataset to identify patterns that lead to heart conditions. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist in diagnosing whether a patient has heart disease based on various clinical health metrics.

*ML Task*
This is a Classification problem. The model is designed to categorize patients into specific groups rather than predicting a continuous numerical value.

*Target Variable*
The target variable is the 'target' column. It is a supervised learning task where:

1 represents the presence of heart disease.

0 represents the absence of heart disease.

*Expected Learning*
The model is expected to learn the relationship between medical features (such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate) and the likelihood of heart disease. The final goal is to predict the diagnosis for new patients with high accuracy.
